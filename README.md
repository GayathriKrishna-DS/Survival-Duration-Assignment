# Survival-Duration-Assignment
The objective of the project is to calculate the duration of how long a person lived based on his Age. The duration should be calculated in different time units like Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds.
Initially i have calculated the age duration in months and simplified the code to calculate the duration in weeks, days, houres, minutes and seconds. I have written the code seperatley for each calculation and later realized that i can simplifly it and used the for loop for doing so.
